* restclient-test.el
~restclient-test.el~ helps you turn [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][restclient.el]] documents into
interactive test suites.

Its functionality is captured by the following animation:

** Usage
A ~restclient.el~ query can be turned into a test by adding a comment
line starting with ~Expect:~ somewhere before the query, followed by
the expected status code. Currently only status code testing is
supported.

The test passes if the expected status code is a substring of the
status code from running the query. So ~Expect: HTTP/1.1 200 OK~,
~Expect: 200 OK~, ~Expect: 200~, and ~Expect: OK~ would all match an
~HTTP/1.1 200 OK~ response.

A full example is shown below.

#+BEGIN_SRC restclient
  # Expect: 200 OK
  GET http://httpbin.org/get
#+END_SRC

Running ~M-x restclient-test-current~ with point inside the query
updates the buffer with the results of the test:

#+BEGIN_SRC restclient
  # Expect: 200 OK
  # Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  # Result: Passed
  GET http://httpbin.org/get
#+END_SRC

Running ~M-x restclient-test-buffer~ runs every test found in the
current buffer and displays a summary of the test results in the echo
area.
